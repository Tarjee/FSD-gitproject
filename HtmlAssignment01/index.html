    <h1> Dessert world</h1>


    <p>
        A dessert is a type of food that is eaten after
        lunch or dinner, and sometimes after a light meal
         or snack. It is usually a sweet food, like ice
          cream, cookies, and cakes. In some countries,
           cheeses such as Brie cheese and fruit are 
           served as dessert.

    <h1>scenarios images</h1>

    <p>
        A scenario is a specific possibility. To 
        plan on playing with a bunch of bear cubs is 
        a scenario — a dumb one, but still a scenario. 
        When people are wondering what to do, they think
         of different scenarios. Moving to a big city is 
         one scenario — moving to a tiny town is another.
